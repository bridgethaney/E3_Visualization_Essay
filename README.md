### Introduction

The Eruptions, Earthquakes, and Emissions project, created by Axis Maps for the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, focuses on volcanic activity and earthquakes occurring around the world since 1960. Utilizing eruption and emission data from the [Smithsonian’s Global Volcanism Program](https://volcano.si.edu/), and earthquake data from the [United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Catalog](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/), this web-based interactive visualization presents changes in data over time during a multi-year time lapse. From January 1960 to January 2017, volcanic eruptions, sulfur dioxide emissions, and earthquakes are tracked and displayed with fluctuating symbology and patterns. This helps designate the locations that are most continuously impacted by any of the featured phenomenon and further delves into the socioeconomic and environmental issues that arise because of potential hazards. In finding the context of the data, exploring the relevance of affective geo-visualizations, and, there can be a better understanding of the importance and advantages of developing and viewing this particular project.

### User Interface and Experience

In emphasizing interactivity and multi-variable options, the project serves as a controllable and highly explorable hub of information. When viewing the map, the time-lapse automatically begins, cycling through all the data for each month and year. The three specified symbols representative of the eruption, emission, and earthquake data points then appear and move and change size depending on the . In looking at earthquakes, the representative symbol, a blue circle, increases or decreases depending on the magnitude of the earthquake. Only the earthquakes with a level five or over magnitude are featured on the map. The volcanic eruptions are given a
