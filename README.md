# Visualization of Eruptions, Earthquakes, and Emissions

### Introduction

	The Eruptions, Earthquakes, and Emissions project, created by Axis Maps, focuses on volcanic activity and earthquakes occurring around the world since 1960. Utilizing eruption and emission data from the Smithsonian’s Global Volcanism Program, and earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Catalog, this web-based interactive visualization seeks to present changes over time through a multi-year time lapse. From January 1960 to January 2017, volcanic eruptions, sulfur dioxide emissions, and earthquakes are tracked and displayed through fluctuating symbology and patterns. This helps designate the locations that are most continuously impacted by any of the featured phenomenon and further delves into the socioeconomic and environmental issues that arise because of potential hazards. In finding the context of the data, exploring the relevance of affective geo-visualizations, and, there can be a better understanding of the importance and advantages of developing and viewing this particular project.
