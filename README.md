# Visualization of Eruptions, Earthquakes, and Emissions

### Introduction

The Eruptions, Earthquakes, and Emissions project, created by Axis Maps, focuses on volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurring since 1960. Utitlizing eruption and emission data from the [Smithsonianâ€™s Global Volcanism Program](https://volcano.si.edu/), and earthquake data from the [United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Catalog](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/), this web-based visualization seeks to present changes over time through a multi-year time lapse. From January 1960 to January 2017, there are notable fluctuations in the volcanic eruptions, sulfur oxide emissions, and earthquakes. This serves to find a pattern in the data 

The audience of this project, therefore, varies based on the all-ec
