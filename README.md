# Visualization of Eruptions, Earthquakes, and Emissions

### Introduction

The Eruptions, Earthquakes, and Emissions project, created by Axis Maps, focuses on volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurring since 1960. Utitlizing eruption and emission data from the Smithsonianâ€™s Global Volcanism Program and earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Catalog, this web-based visualization seeks to present changes over time through a multi-year time lapse. From January 1960 to January 2017, there are notable fluctuations in the volcanic eruptions, sulfur oxide emissions, and earthquakes that expand across the world.
